- display runtime errors nicely (embbed optionnal statement loc ?)
- display parsed tree even in case of a parsing error
- display indented_log even in case of a runtime error
- be able to display warning
- modular parser, generate ast that is different from the program
- lib build target for integration in the language server
- debug expression using $ like this:
	x < y + $(z - a / $b) # dbg b, then dbg (z - a / $b) #
	(or not ?)
- breakpoints that open a debug repl
- debug repl commands can be used in the code with prefix $$
- normal repl
- read and write to variables of other contexts with more precision
- good loop and conditional syntaxes
- bock *call* syntax (or not ?)
- @ is now the current cx (or not ?)
- maybe merge
- globals
- types, conersions
- lazy expressions
- signals (print is a signal going down the stack, input goes up, etc.)
