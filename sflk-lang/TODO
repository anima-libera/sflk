- display runtime errors nicely (embbed optionnal statement loc ?)
- display parsed tree even in case of a parsing error
- display rtlog even in case of a runtime error
- be able to display warning
- BRANCH from this point ( dev branch )
	- debug expression using $ like this:
		x < y + $(z - a / $b) # dbg b, then dbg (z - a / $b) #
	- breakpoints that open a debug repl
	- debug repl commands can be used in the code with prefix $$
	- normal repl
	- read and write to variables of other contexts with more precision
	- good loop and conditional syntaxes
	- bock *call* syntax (or not ?)
	- @ is now the current cx (or not ?)
- maybe merge
- globals
- types, conersions
- lazy expressions
- signals (print is a signal going down the stack, input goes up, etc.)
